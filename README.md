The matlab code for mixed integere TSP construction.  Instead of the common combinatorial opertaions,  a continuous-based  expression and estmate-correct mechnism is designed and used, avoiding the costly branching and exploration operations. After adapation and condiereing the dynamics of the spce design. the code  was extended to the numerical optimiztaion of seuqential asteroid flyby design, and determine the fule-optimal multiple visit with sinle and multiple vehicles.
